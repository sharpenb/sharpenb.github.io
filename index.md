I pursue my Ph.D. in the [Data Analytics and Machine Learning (DAML)](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/startseite/) group at the Technical University of Munich (TUM), where I am supervised by [Stephan GÃ¼nnemann](https://www.in.tum.de/daml/team/guennemann/).

My research focuses on **efficient** machine learning methods for **uncertainty estimation** for different **input** (e.g. tabular, images, graphs, sequential data) and **output types** (e.g. categories, real values, positive counts). In particular, I am interested in defining *desiderata*, *models* and *evaluation* methods for practical uncertainty estimation in real-world applications. Other research interests include *hierarchical and causal inference*, *robust machine learning* and *efficient machine learning*.
